    An Open Homo Sapien Cell Culture Project
</header>
<div class="section">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project aims to build the foundational layer for a personalized biomedicine design system. This project's strategy has three main development components to achieve its mission:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a straightforward protocol for culturing one's cells from a non-invasive oral buccal swab sample. This simple and non-invasive approach minimizes the barrier to participation.</li>
    <li>Develop an open-source cell monitoring and culture device that shares data out of the box. These devices will use standard off-the-shelf parts and 3D printing to maximize accessibility. This device will also use IPFS to share data in a decentralized manner.</li>
    <li>Form a community around this network of devices to collaborate on optimizing protocols, improving device designs, and analyzing data.</li>
</ol>
<p>We imagine this layer will produce the capacity for conducting cell differentiation and organoid generation studies in a near real-time collaborative manner with a large diversity of cell profiles. This platform would allow for robust and community-driven testing of biomedicine designs.</p>
